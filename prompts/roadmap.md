# TaxSeason Blockchain Tax Reporting Application Roadmap

## Project Overview
TaxSeason is an application designed to collect blockchain wallet activity and generate CSV files containing all necessary information for tax calculation purposes. The initial focus is on Arbitrum One network, with potential expansion to other networks.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js
- Blockchain Data: The Graph Protocol

## Development Roadmap

### 1. Project Setup & Architecture Design
- [x] Set up project repository and structure
- [x] Initialize React frontend application
- [x] Initialize Node.js backend application
- [ ] Design architecture diagram showing data flow from blockchain to CSV output
- [ ] Set up development, testing, and production environments
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline

### 2. Data Collection Layer
- [x] Implement wallet connection functionality (basic structure)
- [x] Integrate with The Graph protocol for querying Arbitrum One
- [ ] Create GraphQL queries for different transaction types
- [ ] Implement pagination for large data sets
- [ ] Set up caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Create wallet activity history services

### 3. Data Processing & Analysis
- [ ] Build transaction categorization system (trades, swaps, staking, etc.)
- [ ] Implement cost basis calculation algorithms
- [ ] Create capital gains/losses calculation logic
- [ ] Handle special case transactions:
  - [ ] DeFi protocols interactions
  - [ ] NFT transactions
  - [ ] Airdrops and forks
  - [ ] Staking rewards

- [ ] Support different tax calculation methods:
  - [ ] First In, First Out (FIFO)
  - [ ] Last In, First Out (LIFO)
  - [ ] Average Cost Basis
- [ ] Handle tax implications for different transaction types
- [ ] Implement tax loss harvesting identification

### 5. CSV Export Functionality
- [ ] Design CSV format compatible with popular tax software

- [x] Design and implement user settings page
- [x] Create responsive design for mobile and desktop

### 7. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Develop unit tests for critical components
- [ ] Implement integration tests
- [ ] Perform end-to-end testing
- [ ] Test with real wallet data
- [ ] Verify tax calculations against known examples
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with popular tax software
- [ ] Security and performance testing

### 8. Deployment & Documentation

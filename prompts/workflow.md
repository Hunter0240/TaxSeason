# TaxSeason Development Workflow

This document outlines the development workflow and guidelines for the TaxSeason application to ensure consistent and efficient development.

## Development Environment

1. **Local Setup**
   - Clone the repository
   - Install dependencies for both frontend and backend
   - Set up environment variables
   - Run development servers

2. **Tech Stack**
   - Frontend: React
   - Backend: Node.js
   - Data Source: The Graph Protocol (Arbitrum One)
   - Version Control: Git

## Development Process

### 1. Feature Development

1. **Planning**
   - Review the roadmap to identify the next feature to implement
   - Update the current_state.md file to reflect the feature being worked on
   - Define clear acceptance criteria for the feature

2. **Implementation**
   - Follow the component architecture outlined in component_map.md
   - Create necessary components, services, or utilities
   - Implement the feature according to the acceptance criteria
   - Add appropriate error handling and input validation

3. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for critical functionality
   - Perform manual testing of the feature
   - Test edge cases and potential failure scenarios

4. **Documentation**
   - Update component_map.md if new components were added or existing ones modified
   - Document any API endpoints or services created
   - Update code comments as necessary

5. **Review**
   - Conduct a self-review of the implementation
   - Address any issues identified during testing
   - Ensure the feature meets the acceptance criteria

### 2. Integration

1. **Component Integration**
   - Integrate the feature with existing components
   - Resolve any integration issues
   - Test the integrated system

2. **Backend Integration**
   - Ensure proper communication between frontend and backend
   - Verify data flow between components

### 3. Deployment

1. **Staging Deployment**
   - Deploy to a staging environment
   - Perform end-to-end testing
   - Identify and resolve any deployment issues

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Deploy to production when the feature is stable
   - Monitor for any issues or errors

### 4. Maintenance

1. **Bug Fixing**
   - Identify and prioritize bugs
   - Fix bugs according to priority
   - Add regression tests to prevent recurrence

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Identify performance bottlenecks
   - Implement optimizations
   - Measure and verify improvements

## Code Standards

### 1. Frontend

- Use functional components with React Hooks
- Implement proper state management
- Follow consistent styling conventions
- Ensure responsive design for all components
- Keep components modular and reusable

### 2. Backend

- Follow RESTful API design principles
- Implement proper error handling
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Implement proper input validation
- Structure code into logical modules and services

### 3. General

- Write clear and concise code comments
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Follow consistent code formatting
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task
- Apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles

## Version Control

1. **Branching Strategy**
   - `main`: Production-ready code
   - `develop`: Integration branch for features
   - `feature/[feature-name]`: Individual feature development
   - `bugfix/[bug-name]`: Bug fixes

2. **Commit Guidelines**
   - Write clear and descriptive commit messages
   - Reference related issues or tickets
   - Make small, focused commits

3. **Pull Requests**
   - Create pull requests for feature branches to merge into develop
   - Include a description of changes made
   - Address any review comments

## Documentation

- Keep the roadmap.md up to date with progress
- Update component_map.md when adding or modifying components
- Keep current_state.md current with the latest development status
- Document APIs and critical functionality

This workflow is a guideline and may be adjusted as needed throughout the development process.

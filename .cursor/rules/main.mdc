# TaxSeason Development Rules

## Important: Always Read Prompts First

Before providing any code or implementing new features for the TaxSeason application, always read and reference the contents of the prompts folder, which contains:

- **@prompts/roadmap.md**: Contains the overall development roadmap and current progress
- **@prompts/component_map.md**: Details the component structure for frontend and backend
- **@prompts/current_state.md**: Tracks the current state of development
- **@prompts/workflow.md**: Outlines development workflows and coding standards

These documents serve as the guiding principles for the application's development and should be adhered to when writing code, suggesting improvements, or implementing new features.

## Key Guidelines

1. Follow the component architecture defined in component_map.md
2. Track implementation progress in roadmap.md
3. Update current_state.md when completing tasks
4. Adhere to the coding standards in workflow.md
5. Focus initially on the Arbitrum One blockchain as specified

Always ensure any code suggestions or implementations align with these documents to maintain consistency throughout the development process.
